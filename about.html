<h1> <b> Professional Introduction </b> </h1>

<h2><i>About me</i></h2>  

<p>Hello to a person who will be reading this web page(blog). I would like to introduce myself as short as possible to make my self clear and hopefully maybe one day it will benefit myself.
My name is Gytis Bordiugovas. Currently I am part-time student and studying HNC in Computing course in College. In this blog I will write about vehicles, robots , IT technologies, etc. Most of the 
data written in my articles will be taken from search engines (google, yahoo, etc.) and from variety of books.</p>

<p class="myhobbies">In my free time I like to meet with my friends to go to meet new people and to do some sports such as basketball , football, rugby, etc. I like to play those sports in real life also I like to play them together with my friends
next to gaming machines (PS4, Xbox, Nintendo, etc.).I am happy when I see people cheerful/smiling and pleased next to me. In my spare time I like to go to libraries and do some reading and research about  what is new in our
modern technologies. I am using websites such as Edx.org and Udemy.com to learn about programming and after I am using theory to put them into practise. I am using laptop everyday to communicate with my friends and family over third-party applications while using Internet.</p>
</div>  
</br>
<p>In my previous academic year(2017-2018)  in College I learnt about Computer System Architecture;  Database Design & Development; Networking; Security. This current academic year (2018-2019) I will be learning Professional Practise; Programming Level 4; Website design & Development; Managing a Successful Computing Project modules</p>
<p>I have a lots of passion in technologies since my childhood. I have lots of hobbies. One of my hobbies
 includes programming (logical and object-oriented). I am always keen to learn new skills as I found massive interest in electric vehicles(Tesla, Jaguar, etc.), robots and basically all  IT technologies such as web developing and design
while using languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Java, etc.</p>
